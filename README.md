Specifically, it evaluates the performance of the Mean-Variance model against Minimum Variance as well as the na√Øve portfolio. Comparison will be conducted over three distinct window sizes: 60 months, 120 months, and 180 
months, providing insights into the effectiveness of each portfolio strategy across different periods.
